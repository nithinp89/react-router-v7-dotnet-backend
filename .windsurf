# Project Structure & Architecture
- Projects are split into Frontend and Backend apps. 
- apps/frontend is the frontend app and using React Router v7
- apps/backend is the backend app and using .NET 8.0

# Frontend App
- Follow Remix React Router patterns and use the App routes.
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client functions in Remix.
- Use ".client" in the filename for client-side functions.
- Use ".server" in the filename for server-side functions.
- Client function cannot be called on Server side and vice versa.
- Actions are organized in api folder using loader or action functions.
- Client using Fetch to call API path which inturn exectuve Loader or Action functions.
- No direct database access for the Frontend and using REST API to call the backend.
- All backend calls has to be performed on the server side with jwt in the header
- Frontend can directly access Redis to avoid API or Database calls

# General Code Style & Formatting
- Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting.
- Use lowercase with hyphens for React component file names (e.g., user-card.tsx, not UserCard.tsx).
- Prefer named exports for components.

# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.

# Data Fetching & Forms
- Use React Router v7 Loader for data fetching.
- Use React Router v7 Form for form handling.
- Use Zod for validation.

# State Management & Logic
- Use React Context for state management.

# Backend
- API project contains API endpoints using Minimal API
- Backend connects to Database and Redis Cache
- Authenitcation using jwt passed by Frontend
- Backend responsible for authentication and issuing jwt
- Asp .Net Core identify is used for authentication and authorization
- Backend services are split into different projects
- Core project include the Domain Model like Entities, Value Objects, , Specifications, Interfaces, DTOs, etc.
- Infrastructure project contains database, redis connection, logging, Email Services, and other external services.
- Services project contains business logic
- Features folder in API project contains API endpoints using Minimal API
- DTOs folder in API project contains Data Transfer Objects
- Validators folder in API project contains validation logic using FluentValidation
- Usually, API Endpoints call the Services layer and Services layer calls the Infrastructure layer. And all corresponding interfaces are in Core project.
